<h1>About Thunderstone Quest Card Selector</h1>
<p>
Combos per hero - when we select marketplace cards, try to get at least this many cards per hero which work well with them.<br/>
Also: we try to get monster cards matching at least one hero as well, unless 0 combos per hero has been selected.<br/>
Also: we prioritise cards which haven't been used in previous selections.
